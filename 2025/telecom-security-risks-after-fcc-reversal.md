“FCC reversal removes federal cyber safeguards targeting telecom weaknesses post–Salt Typhoon attacks.”

Reading that headline stopped me in my tracks 🛑

At a moment when state-backed threat groups are actively testing the edges of our telecom infrastructure, rolling back safeguards doesn’t feel like policy recalibration — it feels like stepping onto the battlefield with less armor than before.

As someone who works in intelligence and spends a lot of time studying adversary tradecraft, one thing is clear: attacks don’t slow down or go away just because policy does.

Typhoon didn’t target our telecom infrastructure by accident. They went after it because it’s foundational — it’s the backbone of public safety, national security, and the everyday communication we depend on. This is the infrastructure a mother uses to reach her children during a crisis, the lines families rely on to check whether loved ones are safe, and the networks emergency responders depend on when seconds matter.

Weakening oversight right after a major threat actor exposes those vulnerabilities? That’s the kind of storyline that keeps analysts up at night — because it shows us exactly where the next gaps will open.

Coming from a background in criminal intelligence and now pushing deeper into cybersecurity and infosec, I see this trend from both sides:

🚨Policy creates guardrails.
🚨Operators and analysts defend the gaps in between.
🚨But when the guardrails get pulled back, the gap becomes the attack surface.

This isn’t about politics. It’s about acknowledging that our adversaries are adapting faster than our regulatory frameworks — and the people on the ground are the ones who feel it first.

If there was ever a moment for stronger, clearer, and more future-proofed telecom security standards, it’s right now. Not later. Not after the next intrusion.

Curious to hear how others in cyber, intel, and telecom are reading this shift. Are we bracing for impact, or is there still time to course-correct?
