Working as a Criminal Intelligence Analyst, I’ve spent a lot of time piecing together fragmented information to understand threats before they escalate. Reading this ESG research on cybersecurity, I noticed a lot of overlap.

In both worlds, speed matters, but clarity and precision are everything. Alerts tell you something is happening, but without context, acting quickly can turn into chaos.

A few takeaways that stood out:

🔹 Detection is just the first clue. Investigation and visibility reveal the attacker’s path, helping you understand what’s happening and where.

🔹 Network visibility is the flashlight 🔦. Every packet tells a story — who moved where, what was taken — helping analysts respond with confidence.

🔹 Modern networks need modern visibility. Whether on-prem, hybrid, or multicloud, you need tools that provide a clear picture across all layers.

The takeaway is clear: speed matters, but only confidence turns action into results.
