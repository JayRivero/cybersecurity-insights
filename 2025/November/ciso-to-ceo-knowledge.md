I’m not a CISO or a startup founder, but I’ve been really fascinated lately by how security leaders think — especially after reading “The security leaders who turned their frustrations into companies.”

What really struck me is how many of them didn’t set out to build companies. They were just tired of seeing the same problems over and over again. At some point, frustration turned into fuel, and fuel turned into a business idea.

A few things hit me personally:

1️⃣ Security isn’t just about defense — it’s about seeing opportunity.

These leaders didn’t accept “that’s just how it is.” They saw gaps that everyone else overlooked. That mindset made me rethink how I look at problems in my own work.

2️⃣ Prioritization is a real superpower.

Several of them talked about learning to cut out noise, focus on what matters, and let the rest go. I’m learning that skill myself — especially in tech, where everything feels urgent.

3️⃣ Being stuck can actually push you forward.

One of the leaders mentioned feeling like every day was “Groundhog Day” as a CISO. I’ve felt versions of that too. But instead of staying frustrated, they built something new. That really inspired me.

4️⃣ Security is turning into a business advantage, not just a checkbox.

Hearing how some CEOs lead with security from day one made me realize how much trust plays into success today. It’s not just technical — it’s cultural.

Reading their stories gave me a clearer view of the bigger picture:

👉 Technology is changing fast.
👉 Security is becoming part of every conversation.
👉 And sometimes the people closest to the problems are the ones who end up building the solutions.

I’m nowhere near starting a company — but understanding how these leaders think is helping me understand the landscape better, and honestly, it makes me more excited about the direction I’m heading.
