# 🚨 Insider Threat Hits Even the Best

💥 CrowdStrike just terminated an employee after they allegedly shared internal screenshots with the hacker collective **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters**.

### Key Takeaways

‼️ The insider didn’t just leak documents — screenshots revealed internal dashboards, including links to Okta dashboards.

‼️ CrowdStrike stated that their systems were never breached and no customer data was compromised.

‼️ The case has been escalated to law enforcement.

‼️ This incident highlights a critical reality: attackers increasingly target **human weaknesses**, not just technical ones — especially through third-party access and trusted roles.

### Bottom Line
Even top-tier cybersecurity firms aren’t immune to insider risk. Organizations must invest in both **technical controls** and **cultural vigilance** to reduce the likelihood of insiders becoming their weakest link.

### ❓ Your Thoughts
How are you building trust — and guardrails — to prevent insider threats in your environment?
