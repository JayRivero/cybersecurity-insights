🚨 Insider Threat Hits Even the Best 🚨

💥CrowdStrike just terminated an employee after they allegedly shared internal screenshots with the hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters. 

Key takeaways:

‼️The insider didn’t just leak documents—screenshots showed dashboards, including links to Okta dashboards. 

‼️CrowdStrike insists their systems were never breached, and customer data remained safe. 

‼️The case has been referred to law enforcement. 

‼️ This should serve as a cautionary reminder that attackers are increasingly exploiting not just technical weaknesses, but human ones — often through third-party access and trusted relationships.

Bottom line: Even a top-tier cybersecurity firm isn’t immune to insider risk. As such, organizations must invest in both technological defenses and cultural vigilance.

❓What do you think? How are you building trust — and guardrails — to prevent insiders from becoming your weakest link?
