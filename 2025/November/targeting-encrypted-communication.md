# 🔐 CISA Warns: Threat Actors Target Signal, Telegram & WhatsApp Users

Just finished reading an article from The Cyber Security Hub™, *“CISA Warns Threat Actors Are Using Commercial Spyware To Target Signal, Telegram & WhatsApp Users,”* and I have to say—it was both eye-opening and deeply informative.

Coming from a background in criminal intelligence, I’m well aware of the critical role encrypted messaging platforms like Signal play—not just in national security, but also across law enforcement agencies in multiple jurisdictions. Officers routinely handle sensitive data about suspects, victims, and ongoing operations on these platforms, trusting the end-to-end encryption to protect it.

This article highlighted vulnerabilities that were genuinely concerning. While these platforms do offer strong encryption, the integrity of the device itself is often overlooked by everyday users—and even by some professionals. Equally alarming is the concept of **“zero-click” compromises**, where victims can be infected without opening a message or clicking a link.

I’ve had discussions with former co-workers who confidently believed that as long as you didn’t click a link in an email, you were safe. This article shatters that assumption and reinforces a sobering reality: individuals who aren’t aware of how modern cyberthreats operate are seriously ill-equipped to recognize or mitigate them.

Reading this reminded me how critical it is to continuously update our understanding of cybersecurity—not just for personal protection, but to safeguard sensitive information in professional and operational contexts.

**If you’re in law enforcement, intelligence, or even just someone who handles sensitive data online—this is a must-read.**
