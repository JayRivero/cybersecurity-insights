🔥 Phishing Simulations Gone Too Far? 🔥

I recently spoke with friends at a company that uses a third-party cybersecurity vendor to provide security awareness training and simulated phishing attacks. Lately, there’s been a major uptick in the number of phishing simulations being sent—each designed to help employees spot suspicious emails, URLs, and other red flags.

On the surface, this is a solid approach to building cyber awareness. But here’s the catch: on some days, employees are receiving 2–3 simulations per day, each triggering a mandatory 1-hour refresher course if clicked.

The result? Alert fatigue, fear, and avoidance. Some employees have even deleted legitimate emails because they’re terrified of falling for a simulation. Statements like, “I’m to the point where I don’t want to open anything” aren’t just worrisome—they’re counterproductive.

This posture can slow down business operations, cause missed deadlines, and erode efficiency. It’s a classic case of security hygiene vs. business agility.

✅ The takeaway: Using third-party vendors to increase cybersecurity knowledge and accountability is fantastic. But an overbearing approach that instills fear instead of awareness can do more harm than good.

In today’s rapidly evolving threat landscape, we need to balance security education with operational efficiency, creating a culture where employees are empowered—not paralyzed—by cybersecurity initiatives.

💡 Security awareness is essential—but so is a culture that allows employees to act confidently and efficiently in the digital workplace.
