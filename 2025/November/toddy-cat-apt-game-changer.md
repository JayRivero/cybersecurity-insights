🚨 ToddyCat APT is stepping up its game—now targeting Outlook archives and Microsoft 365 tokens 🚨

Working in criminal intelligence, I’ve seen firsthand how adversaries constantly adapt, and ToddyCat is a perfect example of exploiting overlooked vulnerabilities. Here are a few lessons that hold true across industries:

1️⃣ Small oversights can have big consequences. Whether it’s a misconfigured account, an unmonitored token, or a forgotten archive, attackers know how to find them.

2️⃣ Threats aren’t just technical—they’re behavioral. Understanding the patterns and motivations behind attacks is just as important as the tools themselves.

3️⃣ Proactive monitoring pays off. Early detection and intelligence-driven responses can stop incidents before they escalate.

4️⃣ Security is everyone’s responsibility. From IT teams to leadership, staying aware and practicing good digital hygiene is crucial in every organization.

From my experience, analyzing adversaries’ patterns—much like cybersecurity professionals track threat actors—can provide the insights needed to anticipate attacks and strengthen defenses before incidents escalate.

How is your team translating threat intelligence into actionable defense strategies? I’d love to hear your thoughts! 🛡️💻
