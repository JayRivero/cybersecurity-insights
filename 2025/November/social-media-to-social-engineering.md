# ⚠️ The Hidden Social Engineering Danger Behind Some Social Media Polls

---

🔥 **1️⃣ They gather personal preferences (pretext-building fuel)!**

Questions like:

- “Which MFA method do you use?”  
- “What VPN does your company rely on?”  
- “Which email provider does your org use?”  

Even harmless-sounding questions can reveal:

- Your tech stack  
- Your security practices  
- Your behavior patterns  

This helps attackers craft high-credibility phishing attacks.

🔥 **2️⃣ They identify who engages the most!**

People who comment, vote, or react:

- Are more likely to engage again  
- Can be targeted for DM phishing  
- Reveal psychology and communication style  

Attackers love engagement data.

🔥 **3️⃣ They create trust and familiarity!**

A poll feels harmless → you vote → attacker now:

- Knows you viewed their post  
- May get profile views from you  
- Gains legitimacy in your feed  
- Can warm you up for a connection request or DM  

This is classic social-engineering rapport building.

🔥 **4️⃣ They can map your organization!**

Polls like:

- “Are you working remote or onsite?”  
- “Does your company enforce MFA?”  

…can help attackers understand:

- Attack surface  
- Employee exposure  
- Cyber maturity  
- Optimal attack timing

---

🔥 **5️⃣ They can identify decision-makers!**

Polls about tools, budgets, frameworks, or controls reveal:

- Who influences purchasing  
- Who is technical  
- Who works in what department  

This helps attackers build spear-phishing lists.

🛡️ **How to Protect Yourself:**

- Only engage with polls posted by trusted, established accounts  
- Avoid questions like “which area of your organization would be most vulnerable in an attack” — these directly expose operational weaknesses  
- Steer clear of polls that mention internal tools, security practices, or workflows  
- Never share operational details, even indirectly  
- Be cautious with brand-new accounts posting frequent or provocative polls  
- Ignore any follow-up messages referencing how you voted
