The AI era is forcing a big question across tech and beyond:

Are our computer science programs preparing students for the world we’re moving into—or the world we’re leaving behind?

I recently read “10 Reasons Computer Science Degrees Must Change for the AI Era,” and it really made me pause.

As someone transitioning into IT and cybersecurity from a background in criminal intelligence, law enforcement, and digital forensics, I’ve always known that learning isn’t linear. But this article reminded me of something deeper:

AI isn’t just transforming how we work… it’s redefining what we need to learn in the first place.

Here are a few reflections that stuck with me:

🔹 AI shifts the value from knowing code to understanding systems. If AI can write a function in seconds, the real skill becomes interpreting, validating, and applying it responsibly.

🔹 Adaptability is the new baseline.
The people who will thrive aren’t the ones who memorize the most — they’re the ones who can learn the fastest and master the most relevant skills. 

🔹 We need more real-world context in technical education. Coming from criminal intelligence, I’ve seen firsthand how technology impacts investigations, risk decisions, and public safety. Imagine if CS students learned those intersections earlier and could apply that understanding to whichever field they enter.

🔹 Ethics and critical thinking shouldn’t be electives anymore. AI demands judgment, not just technical precision.

One thing this article reinforced for me is that the future of technology as a whole—and notably specialties like cybersecurity—won’t belong to a single type of background. It will belong to people who can bridge disciplines, understand human behavior, think critically, and adapt quickly.

That’s the path I’m on — building the skills, expanding my technical foundation, and preparing to contribute in a field where AI is reshaping everything.

Computer science degrees don’t need to disappear. But they do need to evolve — and so do we.
