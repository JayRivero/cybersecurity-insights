🛡️ In the Age of AI, Trust Isn’t What It Used to Be

I just came across a powerful piece by Alexander García‑Tobar titled “Authentication in the Age of AI Spoofing” (CIO) — and it’s raising red flags for every leader, security professional, and digital citizen.

Here’s what stuck with me — and why this matters now more than ever:

AI-driven deepfakes, voice cloning, and sophisticated phishing are no longer hypothetical threats — a single spoofed interaction can cost millions. Traditional passwords just don’t cut it anymore.

The way forward:
 • Passkeys + biometrics – secure, phishing-resistant, device-bound
 • Cryptographic verification – proving both user and device
 • Layered MFA – combining tokens, biometrics, and behavioral checks

AI is a double-edged sword: it powers innovation but also arms attackers. Modern authentication isn’t optional — it’s a strategic necessity.

💡 Question for my network: How is your organization adapting to AI-driven identity threats?
