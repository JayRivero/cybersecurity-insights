# 🚨 Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters Are Targeting Zendesk Users

I’ve been tracking a new campaign that highlights how cyber threats evolve fast. Fresh phishing domains and malicious helpdesk tickets are being used to target Zendesk users — attackers are exploiting trust in everyday tools.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Trust, but verify** – Even familiar platforms can be exploited.  
2. **Typosquatting is real** – Small URL changes can lead to major breaches.  
3. **User vigilance matters** – Employee awareness is your first line of defense.  
4. **Proactive monitoring wins** – Early detection can stop attacks before they spread.  
5. **Collaboration counts** – Sharing insights within your organization strengthens security posture.

Cybersecurity isn’t just about tech; it’s about people, processes, and awareness.  

**True cyber resilience isn’t just defense** — it’s seeing the world through an attacker’s eyes, predicting the moves nobody expects, and turning your own systems’ vulnerabilities into a source of insight. It’s a mindset where every process, habit, and piece of awareness becomes a layer of protection, making breaches not just harder to achieve, but almost impossible to catch you off guard. Security isn’t a one-time effort — it’s a continuous evolution, matched step-for-step with the threats themselves.
