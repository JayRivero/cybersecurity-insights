## 🚨 Malicious Browser Extensions: A Long‑Standing Threat

Malicious browser extensions aren’t a “new threat”—they’re a long‑standing one we keep underestimating.  

Recent campaigns abusing Chrome and Edge extensions are just the latest examples of attackers quietly harvesting data, abusing browser logic, and in some cases using the browser as a channel for command‑and‑control and data exfiltration.

The problem isn’t novelty.  

It’s visibility and control.

Here are a few points worth sharpening:

1. **Extensions can act like applications:** If an extension has access to tabs, page content, cookies, or session tokens, it can often reach the same sensitive data your users can in the browser.

2. **Shadow IT thrives in the browser:** Employees routinely install unvetted extensions to “get work done,” and security or IT teams often discover them only after they’re in active use.

3. **C2 and exfil paths evolve quickly:** Malicious extensions can talk to changing domains or APIs, so relying on static blocklists alone leaves large gaps in coverage.

4. **Many orgs still lean toward “default‑allow”:** While some enterprises have tightened controls, extension governance is often far looser than for traditional applications, so least privilege needs to reach the browser ecosystem as well.

5. **Browser risk is not niche:** As more workflows, identities, and data move into SaaS and web apps, the browser has become one of the most exposed and frequently overlooked enterprise surfaces.

If attackers understand the browser better than defenders, that gap will keep widening. Browser security can’t be an afterthought anymore; it has to be treated with the same rigor as endpoints, identity, and network controls, with tighter policies on extensions, better visibility, and stronger configuration management.
