##🚨 AI is becoming the new “unknown variable” inside OT networks — and the NSA says defenders aren’t ready.

As AI-driven automation accelerates across critical infrastructure, new attack surfaces are quietly emerging. And unlike traditional IT systems, OT environments can’t afford surprise behavior — lives, safety, and national stability are on the line ⚡️🏥 🏭

📚 Here are a few takeaways cybersecurity leaders can’t ignore:

1️⃣ AI models can be manipulated, causing unsafe commands or false sensor readings.

2️⃣ OT teams often lack visibility into how AI decisions are made — a perfect recipe for stealthy compromises.

3️⃣ “Shadow AI” is rising, with non-approved tools sneaking into industrial workflows.

4️⃣ Legacy systems weren’t designed to coexist with rapidly evolving AI components.

5️⃣ Adversaries are already experimenting with AI to map, mimic, and disrupt OT behavior.

The message is simple: AI amplifies both capability and risk — and ignoring its impact on OT is no longer an option!!!

💬 Strengthening AI-enabled OT environments starts with bold, informed action—grounded in expertise, driven by collaboration, and focused on building a safer, more resilient future for critical infrastructure.
