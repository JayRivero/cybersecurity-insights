Hi LinkedIn 👋,

Just read a fascinating article, “5 Key Ways Attack Surface Management Will Evolve in 2026”, and it really got me thinking about the future of cybersecurity 🔒.

What struck me most is how ASM is becoming less about reacting to problems and more about anticipating them. It’s about knowing your digital “house” inside and out—every door, window, and hidden corner—so you can keep it safe before anyone tries to break in.

A few insights that stood out:

 1. Always-On Discovery: New assets appear constantly, and ASM will track them in real time.
 2. Smarter Prioritization: AI will help focus on the risks that matter most.
 3. Full Visibility: Seeing both what’s exposed to the outside world and what’s hidden inside.
 4. Security Embedded in Teams: Developers, cloud engineers, and security pros working together from the start.
 5. Proactive Protection: Moving from patching problems to preventing them before they happen 🚀. 

Cybersecurity isn’t just about closing doors—it’s about understanding your space, staying one step ahead, and helping teams feel confident in their digital environment.

Curious how others are approaching ASM in their organizations—would love to hear your thoughts 🤔
